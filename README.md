ðŸŽ¯ OVERVIEW

A comprehensive IoT project using ESP32 to monitor environmental sensors and control LEDs remotely via the MQTT protocol.

This project demonstrates a complete IoT solution where an ESP32 microcontroller:

1.Reads data from an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)

2.Monitors ambient light levels using an LDR sensor

3.Publishes sensor data to an MQTT broker every 5 seconds

4.Controls two LEDs (Red & Green) based on MQTT commands

5.Enables remote monitoring and control via a Python script

ðŸ”§ HARDWARE COMPONENTS

1.ESP32 DevKit C V4 (x1) â†’ Acts as the main microcontroller responsible for reading sensor data, controlling LEDs, and communicating with the MQTT broker.

2.HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (x1) â†’ Connected to TRIG pin 25 and ECHO pin 26. Used to measure distance in the range of 2 cm to 400 cm.

3.LDR (Photoresistor) Sensor (x1) â†’ Connected to analog pin 34 (ADC input). Detects surrounding light intensity and provides an analog voltage output.

4.Red LED (x1) â†’ Connected to Anode pin 23, Cathode to GND. Used as Status Indicator 1 (e.g., system alerts or threshold triggers).

5.Green LED (x1) â†’ Connected to Anode pin 22, Cathode to GND. Used as Status Indicator 2 (e.g., successful connection or operation status).

ðŸŒ³ MQTT TOPIC TREE

All topics are organized under the main topic prefix: mqtt-demo/

1.mqtt-demo/ultrasonic â€” (Publish) Used by ESP32 to send distance data from the Ultrasonic sensor.

2.mqtt-demo/light â€” (Publish) Used by ESP32 to send light intensity data from the LDR sensor.

3.mqtt-demo/led1 â€” (Subscribe) Used by ESP32 to receive control commands for the Red LED. Accepts commands like "on" or "off".

4.mqtt-demo/led2 â€” (Subscribe) Used by ESP32 to receive control commands for the Green LED. Accepts commands like "on" or "off".
